# final_project
My Project is all about address book to save anyone's info
Here is one form that takes value from a user in the form of array 
and saves in localstorage by using setItem
Here is one validation I used in this form
Using If statement,If any of the text field empty,
It sends an alert message to the user to fill that empty field.
I use the reset function to reset all the fields after saving all the data.
Here is one other form that shows the output values that is already saves 
in the localstorage by using getItem function
It takes the name as the key that gets the values of that key from localstorage.

Thank You.
